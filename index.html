            <h4>Goal</h4>
            <p>I wanna be DevOps. The DevOps culture puts a focus on creating a fast and stable work process(flow) through development and IT operations. One main goal of DevOps is to deploy features into production quickly and to detect and correct problems when they occur, without disrupting other services.I’m ready to hit the books and pull all-nighters! As a hobby I prefer web-desigh. I really into page making because for me that’s entirely new right now. I want to learn more web programming and create my own portfolio site.</p>
            <p>I am the head of my group in the University, so I have experience in teamwork, as well as the ability to lead a team. I consider myself a creative and creative person. In my free time I am fond of drawing and design, I am engaged in self-study. I am sociable, responsible, purposeful, persistent, I can argue my opinion.</p>
